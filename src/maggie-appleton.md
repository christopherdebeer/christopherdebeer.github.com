Designer, anthropologist, illustrator. Her [garden](https://maggieappleton.com) combines visual essays with [[digital-gardens|digital garden]] principles.

Key contributions:
- [History and ethos of digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
- Visual language for complex ideas
- [[epistemic-status]] patterns (seedling/budding/evergreen)
- Maintaining the [digital-gardeners](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) resource

Her framing emphasizes gardens as "topography over timeline"—navigating by connection rather than chronology.

She highlights unsolved problems: navigation patterns, discovery mechanisms, infrastructure complexity. [[digital-gardens]] lack the mature tooling of blogs.

Her work bridges theory and practice, showing what [[thinking-in-public]] looks like.
