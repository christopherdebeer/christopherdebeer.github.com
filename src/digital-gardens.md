A digital garden rejects the blog's tyranny of chronology. Instead of finished posts sorted by date, you cultivate [[evergreen-notes]] organized by [[bi-directional-links|connection]].

The form emerged from [[hypertext-pioneers]] but was named and refined by practitioners like [[maggie-appleton]] and [[andy-matuschak]].

Key properties:

1. **Topography over timeline.** Navigate by association, not recency.
2. **Continuous growth.** Notes evolve. Nothing is "published" and done.
3. **Learning in public.** Show rough work. Use [[epistemic-status|status markers]].
4. **Personal and idiosyncratic.** Your garden, your rules.

Gardens work because [[bi-directional-links|linking]] creates context, and context creates meaning. A note's value compounds with each connection.
