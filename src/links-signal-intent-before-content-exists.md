title: Links signal intent before content exists

Creating a link to a non-existent page is a creative act.

It says: this concept matters enough to deserve its own note. Later.

[[digital-gardens]] treat broken links not as errors but as placeholders. The link creates space for future growth. It marks a gap in understanding worth filling.

This inverts typical workflows. Usually: write content, then link. Here: link first, content follows intent.

Benefits:
- Writing flows without stopping to create stubs
- Patterns emerge (frequently-linked stubs → important gaps)
- [[bi-directional-links|Backlinks]] accumulate before pages exist
- Pressure builds organically to fill valuable gaps

When you notice yourself linking to [[concept-x]] repeatedly, that's your garden telling you what to grow next.
