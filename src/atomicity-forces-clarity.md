title: Atomicity forces clarity of thought

The constraint of one idea per note is a thinking tool.

If you can't isolate a concept into its own note, you don't understand it well enough. The act of [[evergreen-notes|atomizing]] forces you to identify the actual claim.

Large notes hide confusion. They let you gesture at ideas without pinning them down. [[andy-matuschak]] notes finish in under 30 minutes because they're bounded.

Benefits of atomic notes:
- Titles become meaningful (each is a claim)
- [[bi-directional-links|Links]] become precise (point to specific ideas)
- Reuse becomes possible (same concept, different contexts)
- Gaps become visible (missing atoms for synthesis)

The practice answers: what is this note actually about? If the answer sprawls, split the note.
