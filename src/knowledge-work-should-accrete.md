title: Knowledge work should accrete not evaporate

Most knowledge work disappears. Meetings end. Projects finish. Insights fade.

[[andy-matuschak]]: "Many activities feel like knowledge work but don't compound." Reading without notes. Discussing without writing. Planning without artifacts.

[[evergreen-notes]] fix this. Each note is a durable unit. Time spent writing compounds because the output remains useful and findable.

The accrual mechanism:
1. Write atomic insight
2. Link to related notes
3. Notes reinforce each other
4. Network becomes more valuable
5. Future writing gets easier (ideas already articulated)

This contrasts with the blog model where old posts ossify. Or corporate wikis where information rots. Gardens compound because [[bi-directional-links]] keep old notes discoverable and new notes connected.

If your note-taking doesn't accrete, you're just processing, not building.
