Hello world, this is my first time using the [Jekyll blogging engine](http://jekyllrb.com/), and I hope it goes well. This blog should serve to replace my old (and languishing) Blogger blog: [theempirecollective](http://empirecollective.blogspot.com/). I hope to use it as a means of promoting the projects I'm working on at any given time, hopefully that will provide some critical introspection which I think could only improve the quality of my own side projects and contributions to the open source community.

The first project I hope to share, is that of **[Hub.js](https://github.com/christopherdebeer/Hub.js)** - a thought experiment that I currently cant get out of my head. Until such time as I pin down its uses or prove that the idea is flawed, it seems promising. So if you can bare with me, my second post on this blog will be a deep dive into what **[Hub.js](https://github.com/christopherdebeer/Hub.js)** is, how it works and why I think its a good idea to use it. (or at least adopt the paradigm it presents/illustrates).
