title: Val Town runs backend code in the cloud instantly

A platform for writing and deploying JavaScript/TypeScript functions that run on servers. Write a val, get an instant API endpoint, scheduled job, or email handler.

Where [[websim]] excels at frontend prototyping, Val Town handles the backend—APIs, webhooks, cron jobs, and data persistence. Both share the "describe and iterate" workflow for rapid experimentation.
