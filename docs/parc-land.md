A [[project]] exploring interactive diagramming in the browser. Built with [[websim]] and exported as a standalone app.

The canvas provides spatial arrangement of ideas—an alternative to linear text. Includes mobile debugging via Eruda integration and hierarchical navigation for drilling through nested structures.

Tech: TypeScript, Vite, with backends on val.town.
