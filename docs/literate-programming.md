Donald Knuth's insight: programs should be written primarily for humans to read, with execution as a secondary concern. Source files become essays that happen to compile.

The key inversion—write prose that contains code, not code that contains comments. Explanation drives structure.

Modern echoes: Jupyter notebooks, Org-mode babel, [[dotlit]].
