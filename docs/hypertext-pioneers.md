Before the web flattened hypertext into one-way links:

**Vannevar Bush** (1945) — "As We May Think" described the memex, a device for storing and linking personal knowledge trails.

**Ted Nelson** (1960s) — Coined "hypertext." Xanadu project envisioned [[bi-directional-links]], transclusion, version control.

**Doug Engelbart** (1968) — Mother of All Demos showed linked documents, collaborative editing.

The web implemented degenerate hypertext: one-way links, no backlinks, no transclusion. [[digital-gardens]] try to recover what was lost.

Modern tools (Roam, Obsidian, Notion) implement pieces of the original vision. Bi-directional links especially.

The pioneers understood: [[knowledge-work-should-accrete]] requires infrastructure. Links aren't just navigation—they're the mechanism of thought.
