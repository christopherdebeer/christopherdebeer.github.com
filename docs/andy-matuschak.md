Software engineer, designer, researcher. Former Apple and Khan Academy.

His [working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org) demonstrate [[evergreen-notes]] in practice—a dense network of atomic, linked ideas about learning, tools for thought, and creative work.

Key contributions:
- [[evergreen-notes|Evergreen notes]] concept
- "[[knowledge-work-should-accrete]]"
- Emphasis on [[writing-for-yourself-reduces-friction|writing for yourself]]
- [[atomicity-forces-clarity|Atomic]] note structure

His system draws from Zettelkasten but emphasizes concept-orientation over source-indexing. Notes factor by idea, not by what you read.

The notes themselves embody their philosophy: useful, linked, evolving.
