Labeling how confident or complete a note is changes how readers engage with it.

[[digital-gardens]] commonly use growth metaphors:
- **Seedling** 🌱 — rough idea, just planted
- **Budding** 🌿 — developing structure, needs work
- **Evergreen** 🌲 — mature, stable, reliably useful

This differs from publication's binary: draft or final.

Benefits:
- Permission to publish rough work ([[thinking-in-public]])
- Reader calibration (expect less from seedlings)
- Visible growth trajectory
- Reduces perfectionism ([[writing-for-yourself-reduces-friction]])

[[maggie-appleton]] popularized this specific metaphor. Others use confidence percentages, last-updated dates, or explicit epistemic statements.

The point: transparency about completeness. Notes are never done, but some are more done than others.
