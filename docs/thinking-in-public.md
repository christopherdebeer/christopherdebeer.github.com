Sharing unfinished work creates accountability to your ideas.

When thoughts stay private, they can remain vague. Publishing—even to an audience of zero—forces articulation.

[[digital-gardens]] make this sustainable by:
- Labeling maturity ([[epistemic-status|seedling, budding, evergreen]])
- Expecting evolution (nothing is final)
- Celebrating rough edges (that's the authentic thinking)

[[maggie-appleton]] calls it "learning in public." You show process, not just polish.

Risks exist. Embarrassment. Misunderstanding. But [[writing-for-yourself-reduces-friction]] mitigates this: you're not writing for the audience, you're writing for yourself with the garage door up.

The compound benefits: feedback, connections, forcing function for clarity, external memory, serendipitous discovery by others.
