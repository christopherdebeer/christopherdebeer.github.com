When A links to B, B should know about A. This simple property transforms a collection of notes into a network.

Traditional hyperlinks are one-way. You can go there but you can't see what points here. Bi-directional links fix this. Every link creates a backlink.

This matters because:

1. **Structure emerges from content.** No need to pre-organize. Link patterns reveal clusters naturally.
2. **Serendipity increases.** Unexpected connections surface through backlinks.
3. **Notes stay discoverable.** Orphan notes are visible failures. [[links-signal-intent-before-content-exists|Even broken links]] serve purpose.

The concept appears in [[digital-gardens]], wikis, and tools like Roam, Obsidian, and Notion.

Bi-directional links enable [[knowledge-work-should-accrete|knowledge accrual]] by making every addition strengthen the whole network.
