title: Writing for yourself reduces friction

Write for your future self, not an audience.

When you write for others, you:
- Over-explain obvious things
- Hedge and qualify unnecessarily
- Self-censor interesting tangents
- Delay until ideas feel "ready"

When you write for yourself, you:
- Get to the point
- Follow curiosity freely
- Ship rough drafts as [[epistemic-status|seedlings]]
- Actually write

[[andy-matuschak]] describes his notes as "roughly my thinking environment." They work because he's not performing.

This principle enables [[thinking-in-public]] without the paralysis of public performance. You're just gardening. Others can peek over the fence.

The friction reduction compounds. Less friction → more notes → more [[bi-directional-links|links]] → more value → more motivation → more notes.
